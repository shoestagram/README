# Shoestagram

Inspired by Instagram, Shoestagram is a visual shopping experience for sneakerheads. Users can browse or search for a specific sneaker model in their home page, go to a details page with model specifications along with a choice to “BUY IN STORE” or “BUY ONLINE”, and customize their wishlist by logging in.

- The front-end was built using HTML5, CSS, and React.
- With Node.js, Tumblr, Amazon, and Ebay API’s were used to populate our MySQL database.
- With Express.js, we created our own server with Express.js to provide endpoints to the front-end.
